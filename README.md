# Crop Production in India Analysis

The Agriculture business domain, as a vital part of the overall supply chain, is expected
to highly evolve in the upcoming years via the developments, which are taking place on
the side of the Future Internet. This paper presents a novel Business-to-Business
collaboration platform from the agri-food sector perspective, which aims to facilitate the
collaboration of numerous stakeholders belonging to associated business domains, in an
effective and flexible manner.
This dataset provides a huge amount of information on crop production in India ranging
from several years. Based on the Information the ultimate goal would be to predict crop
production and find important insights highlighting key indicators and metrics that
influence the crop production.Business Intelligence tools such as Power BI to get a visual
understanding of the data.

It involved

ï‚· Removing the null values from production,area,crops etc.

ï‚· Converting production values in Bales and Nuts units to tonnes

ï‚· Deleting the old yield column and adding a new one using Power
Query(Yield=Production/Area)

ï‚· Removing outliers(Many crops had some extreme values of yield)

3)Working on the final dashboard

The yield and crop production values were analysed by several factors such as
state,crop,season of crop,area etc

Trend of yield and production values over the 1997-2019 interval were also
analysed .

Various insights were also extracted from the data

4)Publish to web.

The dashboard was published to Power BI web from Power BI desktop
